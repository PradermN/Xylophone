  - `TextButton` — Interactive buttons with gesture detection
  - `Text` & `TextStyle` — Typography and styling
  - `Scaffold` — App structure
  - `SafeArea` — Safe layout handling
  - `StatelessWidget` — Building reusable components
- Integrate **audio playback** with the `audioplayers` package
- Use the `AudioPlayer` class to play sound assets
- Create **musical notes** (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si) with unique sounds
- Run and test the app on a configured **Android emulator**

## 📱 Description
